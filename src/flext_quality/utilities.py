"""DEPRECATED AND REMOVED: This file contained unused code.

All utilities have been consolidated into appropriate modules:

- Issue processing → models.py (IssueModel methods)
- Report formatting → reports.py (TextReportBuilder, JsonReportBuilder, HtmlReportBuilder)
- Score/metrics calculation → grade_calculator.py, metrics.py
- Test file generation → can be implemented in tests/helpers/ if needed

This file was not used anywhere in the codebase (confirmed via grep).
It has been removed to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.

See git history for previous implementation.
